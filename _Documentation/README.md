# Calendar

## Introduction
Calendar is a .NET application built on .NET 8.0 using Blazor.

This project will attempt to follow an IDesign design pattern. More information about this architecture can be tracked down here https://www.idesign.net/

Calendar will mostly be used as a learning sandbox for me to explort Web Development using Blazor and .NET 8.0.

This will also be my first attempt at really diving into project management and execution through GitHub.

## Setup
This project will require that the user has .NET 8.0 installed. More information about installation of .NET 8.0 can be found here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

## CI/CD
I don't really have plans to publish this anywhere, but for learning GitHub and for keeping standards I've integrated a code analysis tool called CodeQL to scan for security vulnerabilities. I've also setup a YAML file to do a pre-merge build prior to completing pull requests
