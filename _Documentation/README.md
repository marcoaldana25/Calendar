# Calendar

## Introduction
Calendar is a .NET application built on .NET 8.0 using Blazor.

This project will attempt to follow an IDesign design pattern. More information about this architecture can be tracked down here https://www.idesign.net/

Calendar will mostly be used as a learning sandbox for me to explort Web Development using Blazor and .NET 8.0.

This will also be my first attempt at really diving into project management and execution through GitHub.
